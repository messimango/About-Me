        <p>My favorite activity is to go on hikes/walks. There are so many trails and routes you can follow. For the braves ones you can even walk off trail and make your own path. If I am ever feeling
            frustrated, stuck on a problem or anxious, it helps reset my mind. It helps you disconnect from media and brings prespective to life. When I go on walks I usually have my phone for
            emergencies but rarely use it unless its for pictures. It is also a really good excersice and its
            completly free, although there are some national parks and trails that have an entry fee. You also get to experience nature and all it has to offer. Even if you always walk the
             same route the change in seasons can drastically change the landscape. You also begin to relize how small you are and how large the world is. My most favorite places to walk are near
            water. Water attracts many animals and creates a whole new ecosystem to interact with. It is also my hiking partner's favorite thing in the world, other than food of course.

        <h2>Hiking Partner</h2>
        <img src="./images/momo.jpg" id="partner-img">

        <p>This is my hiking partner Momo. She is a 3 year old Golden retriver. She loves going on walks and playing fetch, but there is nothing she loves more than water. She loves swimming! Even if
            there is a small creek she has to jump in. All she needs is water and some snacks and she can walk for miles. Our longest hike was a 35km trail at the Algonquin National Park. It took
            us a total time of 8 hours!. It took us months of conditioning and training so don't try it at home!*
            <br><sup>*Most dogs can only walk for max of 8-15km depending on the breed</sup>
